Sensibull Assignment 

Design/Architecture

*Used conditional rendering for Stocks and Quotes pages. (since it was just 2 pages).
*Used Montserrat font.
*API middleware.
*Simple and minimalistic design.
*Not very mobile friendly (although responsive to some extent)

Improvements/bugs

*Router should have been used.
*One small bug while sorting quotes page with Time (It doesn’t go back to original state ).
*Re-rendring the quotes page with valid time expires could have been optimized since multiple api calls happening with same response data until updated one.
*Visibilitychange listener should have been added for quotes page to update only while viewing the page.
